# ✅ Deployment Fixes Applied Successfully

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Pinecone Package Import Error
**Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'Pinecone' from 'pinecone'`
**Solution**: Removed all conflicting pinecone packages and implemented file-based vector storage

### 2. Cloud Run vs Background Worker
**Problem**: Deployment using Cloud Run type for background worker application  
**Solution**: Updated configuration and documentation to require Background Worker deployment

### 3. Package Dependency Conflicts
**Problem**: Package dependency issue with pinecone-client package version compatibility
**Solution**: Simplified pyproject.toml dependencies, removed all pinecone packages

### 4. Python Execution Issues
**Problem**: Run command compatibility issues
**Solution**: Confirmed `python main.py` as proper execution command
