# Critical Authentication Debug Analysis

## The Problem
Your client is getting HTTP 200 responses with authentication errors, but my server logs show ZERO incoming requests from external sources. This means:

**Your requests are NOT reaching my server at all.**

## Evidence
1. My server logs show comprehensive request logging is active
2. Local tests work perfectly with authentication success
3. Your external requests return HTTP 200 but with auth errors
4. Zero external requests appear in my server logs

## Likely Causes

### 1. Wrong URL/Port
- You might be hitting a different service
- Replit might have multiple instances running
- Port routing issue

### 2. Proxy/CDN Interference
- Replit proxy might be intercepting requests
- Authentication headers stripped by proxy
- Different routing for external vs internal requests

### 3. Different MCP Server Instance
- Another MCP server responding (not mine)
- Old deployment still running
- Service discovery pointing to wrong instance

## Immediate Solution Test

Can you test these specific URLs and report what you get:

1. **Health Check (Should show server info):**
   ```
   GET https://slack-chronicler-andreiclodius.replit.app/health
   ```

2. **Root Info (Should show MCP server details):**
   ```
   GET https://slack-chronicler-andreiclodius.replit.app/
   ```

3. **Current API Key (Should return the actual key):**
   ```
   GET https://slack-chronicler-andreiclodius.replit.app/dev/api-key
   ```

If the health check returns the correct server info and the API key endpoint returns:
`mcp_key_90436aaba9693944acd91e106a84c407601cdc7e2585d7ed`

Then we know you're hitting the right server and there's a specific issue with the /mcp endpoint.

If it returns different info, then you're hitting a different server entirely.

## What to Test
Please run these tests and tell me:
1. What does the health endpoint return?
2. What does the API key endpoint return?
3. Are these the same values I'm seeing in my server?

This will definitively identify whether we have a routing issue or an authentication issue.
